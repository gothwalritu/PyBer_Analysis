# Module 5: PyBer_Analysis

## 1.	Overview of the analysis:

In this challenge we are performing exploratory data analysis on the ride sharing data from PyBer company. We are sorting, visualizing and analyzing the patterns and trends of the ride data for the year 2019 for different types of cities. The type of the city is categorized based on their development status (urban, suburban and rural). In this activity, eventually we created a graph to present the weekly fares based on the type of city for a couple of month in order to compare them and which might help the management in decision making to improve the accessibility and affordability of ride services to the customers. 

## 2.	Results:

We developed a table for total number of rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver with the help of groupby function with respect to three different types of city, which are urban, suburban and rural. In order to obtain the table 2.1, we used gruopby, sum, mean, count functions. The table 2.1 is used to plot the multiline graph shown in figure 2.1, for total fare by city type from January 2019 to March 2019. With this activity we are able to find out that the urban cities generate most rides and fare, followed by suburban and rural cities. There is a spike and dips in the total fares of all the city types at the same day. And the pattern of the line graph is almost similar and these lines are not intersecting each other.

## 3.	Summary:

On the basis of this analysis my recommendations are:

**First,** to gather more information on the traffic and frequency of rides on a particular day and time. And how much percentage of population is using this facility. It could be one of the reasons that in rural areas public is more inclined to drive their own vehicle instead of taking taxi. Another reason could be that people are travelling less often in comparison to urban and suburban areas. So, if we know the total traffic and the percentage of mode of travel (private vehicle, public transport and taxi) will help us in improving the services. 

**Second,** recommendation will be to investigate the reason of spike and dips in total fare over the period of investigation. There could be certain festivals and holidays which might affect the demand for rides services. Hence, there could be other social or any other factor which might be influencing the certain spikes and dips in the total fare of the moth or week.

**Third,** recommendation would be, to find out the routes which are more frequently traveled and on which days it is happening. As there might be some relation in working days and weekends with the kind of destinations and places. And certainly, there is some correlation between the days and total fare which is worth investigating further.
